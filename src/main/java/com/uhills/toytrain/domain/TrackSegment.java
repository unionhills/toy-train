 * A TrackSegment is represents 1 section of track. If you think of

 * end points at 2 different edges of the square.
 * 
 * For example, a "NorthSouth" section is a vertical track segment
 * with one end point at the North end and the South end.
 * 
 * When connecting Track segments together, the end user needs to make
 * sure that the end points between segments link up if they want to
 * make a complete track.
